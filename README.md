Hi, I'm RubÃ©n Crespo Blanco, a biotechnology and bioinformatics researcher from Spain, self-learned coder. My primary research interests lie in transcriptomics, NGS, field research and bioinformatic method development for environmental metagenomics. I wish to apply the state-of-the-art research methods of these fields to extremophyles and astrobiology research, bioprospecting, genome mining and WGS of new species. The objective: understanding all the breadth of biological diversity, one species at a time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in the fields above mentioned.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fundamental skills in bioinformatics and metagenomics
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/Ruben-Crespo-Blanco/Ruben-Crespo-Blanco/issues) in English or Spanish
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at rcresb@gmail.com
